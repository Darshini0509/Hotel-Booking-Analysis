 Hotel-Booking-Analysis
In this data analysis project, several key tasks were undertaken. Firstly, data cleaning was carried out to ensure the dataset's integrity and quality. This involved addressing any inconsistencies or errors in the data.

Subsequently, a descriptive analysis was conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics and features.

A significant part of the analysis focused on performing spatial analysis on the guests' hometown data, potentially revealing insights into where the majority of guests originate.

Furthermore, the project involved an investigation into the differences between the assigned and reserved room types, shedding light on potential discrepancies or trends in this aspect.

One of the central questions addressed was determining which market segment had the highest number of bookings, providing valuable insights into the business's primary customer base.

The analysis also delved into understanding patterns in guest arrivals, potentially identifying peak times or trends in guest check-ins.

Finally, the distribution of guest arrivals was closely examined, offering a more detailed perspective on when guests tend to arrive and how this distribution varies over time.

In summary, this project encompassed data cleaning, descriptive analysis, spatial analysis, room type analysis, market segment analysis, guest arrival patterns, and the distribution of guest arrivals to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
